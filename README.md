# Image-Processing-Python
Fundamental image processing issues as: 
PART_1: Gradient (backward, central, forward), gradient magnitude, gradient angle, prewitt and sobel filters, gaussian mask.
PART_2: Image erosion, dilatation (made step by step and by using nd library), opening and closing and adding noise to an image.
PART_3: Histogram and histogram equalization.
ANNOTATION: Circle, rectangle and cardiode generation. 
LIVER-SEGMENTATION: The program proceeds liver segmantation from CT images from medical database and also provides calculating the liver volume. The program allows comparision the calculated volume with images manually segmented in ITK-SNAP program. The program uses such methods as local or global region growing, normalization, dilatation, closing (by gaussian mask) and uses high pass gaussian filter.
